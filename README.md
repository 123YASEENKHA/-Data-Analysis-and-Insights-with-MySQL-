"Executed end-to-end data analysis on a MySQL film rental database, encompassing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and complex SQL queries, providing valuable insights into rental patterns, customer behaviors, and revenue generation."


## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project where we explore a relational database using MySQL for insights and generate various reports to answer specific questions. The project covers topics related to SQL queries, data exploration, and generating actionable insights from the provided database.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the database schema and contents.
2. **Analysis Queries**: SQL queries for answering specific analytical questions.
3. **Views Creation**: Creation of views for simplified reporting and analysis.
4. **README.md**: Project documentation providing an overview, usage instructions, and explanations.

## Database Schema

The project utilizes a database named `film_rental`, and the schema includes tables such as `actor`, `address`, `category`, `city`, `country`, `customer`, `film`, and others.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Setting Up Database**: Make sure to set up the `film_rental` database and tables by executing the necessary SQL scripts provided.

2. **Running Queries**: Execute SQL queries provided in the project to explore data and derive insights.

3. **Viewing Reports**: Check the views created for a consolidated view of key metrics and insights.
